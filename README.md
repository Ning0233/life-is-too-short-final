Purpose of Project
Most of us can relate with the feeling of scrolling on tik tok just to glance at the time and see that 2 hours have passed without us noticing, we decided to build a solution to that we would all want to use in our day to day lifes. Life is too short although it may sound depressing is our idea of a new innovative way to help people off their phones and productive

Tools Utilized
We build our project using html, css and javascript for the frontend and the firebase console for the backend. We utilized several APIs such as Gemini, Spotify and Knock-webapp  to implement features and make our web application more interactive. Auth0 was also implemented to make the signup//register process easier.
